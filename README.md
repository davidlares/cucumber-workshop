# Cucumber Workshop

The BDD acts in the software development perspective like a process for teams to create simple scenarios on how an application should behave from the end user's perspective.

The goal of implementing BDD testing is to improve collaboration between stakeholders. Having all the stakeholders involved from the beginning and throughout the process fosters strong communication and engagement in the product development cycle.

There's a lot of tools out there for performing this kind of tests, but the most popular is `Cucumber` with the help of `Gherkin`

`Cucumber` reads executable specifications written in plain texts and validates that the software does what those specifications say (check `steps/maths.js`). This consists of multiple examples or scenarios

On the other side, there's `Gherkin` a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough for `Cucumber` to understand. (check `features/addition.feature` file for details).
